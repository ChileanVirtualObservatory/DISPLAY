	This  work  is  funded  by  project  FONDEF  D11I1060:  Development  of  an  astro-informatics  platform  for management and intelligent analysis of large-scale data, a collaborative project between several Chilean universities in order to create a Chilean virtual observatory, called Observatorio Virtual Chileno (ChiVO)
	\footnote{\url{http://www.chivo.cl}}.
	ChiVO is an on-line platform that will make available to astronomers the measures of the radio-telescope Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 
	Also, ChiVO will provide several tools to process data from ALMA and to offer specialized information from those measures to astronomers.
